Sign up and create a OAuth Client here : https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in
Add the redirect url to the whitelist and set the authorised domain as domain.com (root domain)
Grab the clientID/Secret and create either a NATIVE Google Namespace or GENERIC


Issue with scheduling was causing renewed credentials to work BUT scheduling anything to fail with error in the logs like:

com.ibm.cognos.camaaa.internal.auth.exception.UserRecoverableException: AAA-OIDC-0010 The provided credentials are invalid. Reason: 'Attempting to obtain refresh token'

To get around this problem set the following property values in the Generic Namespace:

Password Grant
Strategy - Unsupported
Include Scope? - False

Scheduling Credentials
Strategy - ID Token Only
Account Claims - ID Token


and that worked!
