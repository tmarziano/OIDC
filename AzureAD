AzureAD customer switched Return URL from Dispatcher to Gateway and now unable to log in.
Customer found the following:

Solution:fortunately i have found reason why credentials are corrupted when i try to connect through gateway.
I use self-signed cerfificate and there has to be correct Subject Alternative Names for SSL. 
When i created new certificate with correct host name (fully qualified name for gateway) then I was able to log in.


Non-Admin user's unable to log in to CA using AzureAD OIDC Namespace

Solution: Multi-Tenancy so removed that and it worked. I found that in the cogstartup.xml

crn:parameter name="tenantIdMapping" opaque="true">
-<crn:value xsi:type="cfg:tenancyInfo">
<crn:item name="pattern" xsi:type="xsd:string">~/ancestors[1]/defaultName</crn:item>
</crn:value>
</crn:parameter>
